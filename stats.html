            <h1>My Statistically Rigged Casino Games</h1>
            <p>The statistical concepts I used in this activity were expected value and probability distribution. Probability distribution is maps out every possible outcome of a random event (the net gain or loss for the player) and assigns a precise probability to each outcome. The tables in the document illustrate this by showing the two possible results (win/loss), the likelihood of each, and the monetary value assigned. Expected Value is  the long-run average outcome per trial if the game were played an infinite number of times. It is calculated as the sum of all possible outcomes multiplied by their respective probabilities (a weighted average). A positive EV (Game A) means the player is theoretically guaranteed to profit over time, while a negative EV (Game B) guarantees the casino a long-term profit. It is safe to assume that when repeated over multiple iterations, it will eventually lead to the expected outcome by using the Law of large numbers. The law of large numbers is an important theorem in probability that states  as the number of independent trials increases, the average result of the trials will converge to the true Expected Value. While 10 to 15 trials (as used in the simulation) are not mathematically sufficient to guarantee a perfect match, they are typically enough to demonstrate the trend—that is, the average outcome will lean toward the positive EV of Game A and the negative EV of Game B.
Mathematically, this convergence is expressed using limits:
As n approaches infinity the observed average must approach the calculated average


This is used in daily life in many situations such as insurance pricing, financial planning, weather forecasting and quality control. Insurance companies use probability distribution equations to calculate the likelihood of their claims (car accidents, house fires, etc) The set their prices based on these factors so the expected value is slightly beneficial to them

            <p style="font-size: 18px;">Outcome: Player Always Wins (Profit)</p>
            <p>
                This game is played with a standard 52-card deck. The player pays $1.00 to play and bets on whether the drawn card is a Prime Number Card (2, 3, 5, or 7). Face cards (J, Q, K, A) are ignored and result in a redraw. The game is designed to guarantee a positive expected value for the player.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules are summarized below:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cost to play: $1.00.</li>
                    <li>Play: Draw 1 card from a shuffled 52-card deck.</li>
                    <li>Win condition: Card is a Prime Number (2, 3, 5, 7, 16 total cards).</li>
                    <li>Payout: Win $3.50 (net + $2.50).</li>
                    <li>Loss condition: Card is a Composite Number (4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 20 total cards).</li>
                    <li>Loss: Win nothing (net - $1.00).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Probability Distribution</p>
            <p>
                The probability of drawing a Prime card is 16/52, or approximately 0.3077. The probability of drawing a Composite card is 36/52, or approximately 0.6923.

                From this distribution, we calculate the expected value E:
                E = (+2.50 * 0.3077) + (-1.00 * 0.6923). This calculates to approximately +0.7692 - 0.6923, which is +0.0769. This equals about + $0.08, meaning on average the player gains about 8 cents per play.

                This game is played with a six-sided die that is secretly weighted to land on '1' 20% of the time (instead of the fair 16.67%). The remaining sides (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) each have a 16% probability. The player pays $1.00$ and bets on rolling a High Number (4, 5, 6).
