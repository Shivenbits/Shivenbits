        <h1>Shiven @ Johns Hopkins ‚Äî Math Summer Program</h1>
        <p class="lead">A short, personal run-down of my summer math experience at Johns Hopkins University: what I learned, who I met, and the strange-satisfying corners of infinity that made me grin.</p>
        <div class="meta">üìç Johns Hopkins University &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp; Summer Program &nbsp;‚Ä¢&nbsp; A few unforgettable weeks</div>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>üéì Getting Started</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div>
          <h3>Why I chose this program</h3>
          <p class="small">I wanted to be around people who love math as much as I do and to dive deeper into interesting, strange math concepts beyond school.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>First impressions</h3>
          <p class="small">When I first stepped onto campus I felt a mix of excitement and focus. It was familiar yet energizing ‚Äî the kind of place where late-night problem solving feels natural. What surprised me most was how normal it felt to talk about math casually with others.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="full">
          <h3>Meeting my people</h3>
          <p class="small">It felt really good to meet other students who love math. Conversations quickly turned into problem swaps and math curiosity. That immediate sense of shared nerdiness is one of the best parts of the whole experience.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>üß† The Math Itself: Nerd Out a Bit</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div>
          <h3>Most mind-blowing concept</h3>
          <p>I loved learning about the <strong>Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox</strong> ‚Äî it is funny, weird, and somehow delightful. It highlights how infinity behaves in ways that clash with our intuition, and I found it exciting to connect that strangeness to possible ideas in quantum mechanics.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Aha! moments</h3>
          <p class="small">I had a real "math detective" moment when I saw the proof that there are infinitely many primes of the form <em>4k+3</em>. That kind of argument ‚Äî clever and satisfying ‚Äî made me feel like I was unlocking a small secret about numbers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="full">
          <h3>Problems I solved</h3>
          <p class="small">I was particularly proud of constructing a proof related to Fermat's right-triangle theorem. Solving that felt like a personal milestone ‚Äî a great payoff after wrestling with the idea.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>üîç Beyond the Numbers: Activities & Experiences</h2>
      <p class="small">A typical day had a clear rhythm: lessons, break, lessons, food, and sometimes a small activity. It was focused and efficient ‚Äî perfect for diving into math without distractions. There weren't many extra events like field trips or late-night debates, but the steady routine let me concentrate on the math.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>üåç The People You Met</h2>
      <p class="small">Most students were from the US, so there wasn't a huge international mix ‚Äî but the people I did meet were engaged and curious. While no single person stands out in my notes as the most interesting, the overall vibe of students and mentors who took math seriously left a strong impression.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>üåÄ Growth & Reflection</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div>
          <h3>How my thinking changed</h3>
          <p class="small">The program broadened my mathematical vocabulary and introduced me to several new fields. It gave me the words and concepts to express what I was already curious about ‚Äî which made communicating math easier and clearer.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Advice to past me</h3>
          <p class="small">If I could go back to day one I'd tell myself to relax and enjoy the small randomness ‚Äî the best parts aren't always the big theorems, but the tiny discoveries and conversations that happen between classes.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>‚ú® Fun & Personal</h2>
      <div class="fun">
        <p class="small">One charming constant: casual conversation often turned into a math problem. Finish the sentence with me:</p>
        <div class="quote">‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre at a math camp when casual conversation is about math problems and both people are genuinely interested in it.‚Äù</div>
        <p class="small" style="margin-top:10px">A few strange/unexpected things: small moments of randomness and inside jokes about infinity. I‚Äôll miss the fun randomness most of all.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>üì¶ The Big Picture</h2>
      <p class="small">Did the experience change my long-term goals? Not significantly ‚Äî but it reaffirmed my love for exploring new mathematical areas. Would I recommend the program? Yes ‚Äî and my only tip is to go in a little blind: let the program surprise you rather than overplanning what you expect to get out of it.</p>
