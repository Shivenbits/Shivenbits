                <p>
                     Welcome to ShivenBits, a blog talking abolut all the things in science and technology. From the latest innovations in AI and space travel, to the complex mysteries of the universe, you are sure to find something that perks your interests here.
                     I love academics, my favorite subject in school being math and science. My favorite things to do in my free time include cubing geoguessr and playing minecraft. I have a few big achievements, most notable include getting selected for the gifted program at johns hopkins, and solving a rubik's cube in under 20 seconds. If I were to meet a famous person, it would be MrBeast or Fermat(ask him for $10000 and ask him for his last theorem respectively). If I were to have a superpower, it would be teleportation or flight. In the next 5 years I plan on Finishing 50 blogs on my blogs, Getting into my dream university: Harvard, Getting a top 100 rank in a math olympiad and learning Java.
