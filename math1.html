    <h1>ShivenBits: Fun with Numbers</h1>

    <h2>1. Multiply Any Number by 11 in Seconds</h2>
    <p>Since 11 is the first real palindromic number, I was wondering if there is any way to speed up the multiplication process. While experimenting, I found this trick to multiply any 3-digit number by 11 in seconds.</p>

    <h3>🔹 The Two-Digit Shortcut</h3>
    <p>Take any two-digit number. Add the two digits. Write the answer as (first digit) (sum) (second digit). For example:</p>
    <p><strong>52 →</strong> 5 + 2 = 7 → <strong>Answer: 572</strong></p>

    <h3>🔹 What About 3-Digit Numbers?</h3>
    <p>I’m still exploring how this pattern expands to 3-digit numbers. I’ve found a way that works but will be digging deeper to understand why it behaves that way mathematically.</p>


    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h2>2. The Reversing 1089 Trick</h2>
    <p>We were exploring special numbers online and discovered this fun trick involving 3-digit numbers and a surprising result—1089!</p>

    <h3>🔹 How It Works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose any 3-digit number where the first and last digits differ by at least 2. (e.g., 521)</li>
      <li>Reverse the digits: 125</li>
      <li>Subtract the smaller from the larger: 521 - 125 = 396</li>
      <li>Reverse the result: 693</li>
      <li>Add them: 396 + 693 = <strong>1089</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔹 Why Does It Fail Sometimes?</h3>
    <p>This process fails when the difference between the first and last digits is less than 2. The math behind why that happens is something we’re still curious to understand!</p>

    <h2>3. Why Does Dividing by 0 Break Math?</h2>
    
    <h3>🔹 Division as Intuition</h3>
    <p>Division has always felt intuitive—like asking, "How many times does one number go into another?" For example, 12 ÷ 3 just means how many times 3 goes into 12 (which is 4). But what about 12 ÷ 0? That would mean how many times 0 goes into 12. That question doesn’t make any sense!</p>

    <h3>🔹 A Misleading “Proof” that 1 = 2</h3>
    <p>Some people try to "prove" wrong things using division by zero. Here's one such fake proof:</p>
    <pre>
Let a = b
Then a² = ab
a² - b² = ab - b²
(a - b)(a + b) = b(a - b)
Canceling (a - b): a + b = b
Since a = b: b + b = b → 2b = b → 2 = 1 ❌
    </pre>
    <p>Why is this wrong? Because you’re dividing both sides by (a - b), which is zero. That breaks the rules of math!</p>

    <h3>🔹 Final Thoughts: The Fragility of Math Rules</h3>
    <p>So from both intuitive and mathematical views, dividing by 0 leads to undefined or broken logic—and that’s why it’s simply not allowed in math!</p>

    <div class="spacer"></div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <h3>🔹 The Power of Curiosity in Math</h3>
    <p>Each of these tricks teaches us that asking “why” can take you deeper into understanding math—not just how to solve problems, but why things work.</p>

    <h3>🔹 Keep Exploring!</h3>
    <p>Math isn’t just about formulas—it’s full of puzzles, patterns, and hidden surprises. Stay curious and keep asking questions!</p>
